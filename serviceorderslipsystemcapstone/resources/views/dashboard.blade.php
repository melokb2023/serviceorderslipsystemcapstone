The company specializes in determining the type of maintenance and service required for the service, then documents it into the system for the staff to use it as a reference point as well as 
a way for the staff to keep them notified of the other services that will continue to spread during the process of running the business. In some cases depending on how bad the damage is done, there are things that replacement is needed
